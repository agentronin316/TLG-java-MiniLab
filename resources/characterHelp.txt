                                        Character Selection Guide
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|* Characters in Konsole Combatâ„¢ allow players to further customize their play styles.                          |
|* Like attack types mentioned earlier, different characters effect damage and accuracy stats.                  |
|* The DEFAULT character is the base experience. No change to accuracy or damage here.                          |
|* The PRECISE character increases accuracy at the cost of less damage.                                         |
|* The WILD character is all about damage. Using this character gives a boost to damage but accuracy is reduced.|
|*                                                                                                              |
|* TIP: Characters can be used to offset the weaknesses of weapons or amplify their advantages.                 |
