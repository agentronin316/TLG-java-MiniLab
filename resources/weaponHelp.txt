                               Weapon Selection Guide
|*******************************************************************************************|
|* Weapons are how fighters deal damage to one another.                                     |
|* Below are the weapons available for players to use.                                      |
|* As you can see, each weapon has an attack or attacks that are unique to that weapon.     |
|* Attacks have two factors that relate to damage; Accuracy and Damage modifiers.           |
|* The more accurate the attack, the more likely you are to land the attack.                |
|* Damage modifiers add an extra punch based on which attack type is used.                  |
|* BALANCED attacks are the best of both worlds, decent accuracy and small bump to damage.  |
|* ACCURATE attacks the most likely to hit but come at the cost of reduced damage.          |
|* HEAVY attacks offer the most damage boost to an attack but come at the cost of accuracy. |
|*                                                                                          |
|* TIP: If bow is selected, the player is able to launch an attack before the normal combat |
|* sequence.                                                                                |
